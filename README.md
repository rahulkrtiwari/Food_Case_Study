# Food_Case_Study

The purpose of this case study is to offer another illustration of market segmentation
analysis using a different empirical data set.
This data set was collected originally for the purpose of comparing the validity
of a range of different answer formats in survey research investigating brand image.
Descriptions of the data are available in Dolnicar and Leisch (2012), Dolnicar and
Grün (2014), and Grün and Dolnicar (2016). Package MSA contains the sections of
the data used in this case study.
For this case study, imagine that you are McDonald’s, and you would want
to know if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of
McDonald’s. Understanding such systematic differences of brand perceptions by
market segments informs which market segments to focus on, and what messages to
communicate to them. We can choose to focus on market segments with a positive
perception, and strengthen the positive perception. Or we can choose to focus on a
market segment that currently perceives McDonald’s in a negative way. In this case,
we want to understand the key drivers of the negative perception, and modify them.
